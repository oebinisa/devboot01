The Boy Who Cried Wolf:

Once, long ago, there was a mischievous boy who looked after
some sheep near a village. The boy was often bored and so one
day he decided to play a trick on the villagers.

“Wolf! Wolf!” he shouted loudly.

The villagers came rushing up the hill to
save the sheep. However, when they got
there, there was no wolf to be seen. The boy
laughed with glee. “I tricked you!” he said.

“You must not tell lies!” shouted the
villagers angrily and they returned to the village.

Soon, the boy grew bored again. He thought for a moment and
shouted, “Wolf! Wolf!” Once more, the villagers rushed up the
hill to save the sheep.

The boy laughed at them.
“I tricked you again!” he said.

“You must not tell lies!” shouted
the villagers. They hurried back
down to the village.

Later that day, a huge wolf really did come into the field. The
boy cried and cried, “Wolf! Wolf!”

This time, the villagers didn’t believe the boy.
Therefore, no one came to help and
the wolf gobbled up all the sheep.

No one believes
a liar, even if they
are telling the truth.
